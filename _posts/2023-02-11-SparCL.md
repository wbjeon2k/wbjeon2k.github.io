# Sparse Continual Learning on the Edge

NeurIPS 2022 paper.

## **TLDR**

![sparclalgo](/images/sparcl/sparclalgo.png)  
- Task-aware dynamic mask TDM :
  Based on $CWI$, keep only important weights for both current & past tasks.  
  ++ consider task transition  
- Dynamic Gradient Masking DGM :
  Based on $CGI$, select important weights to update,  
  only a subset of sparse weight updated to leverage gradient sparcity.

- **Category** (Specific): Continual Learning, Lottery Ticket Theorem

# Paper Summary (What)
 
1. Use two types of masks, $M_w$ and $M_g$ based on slightly different importance metrics.
2. Dynamic Data Removal DDR : remove 'easy' examples regarding to loss,  
keep more informative examples in the replay buffer.
3. $CWI$ for $M_w$  
$$
CWI = \text{L1 norm of }W + \text{gradient w.r.t task data } D_t
+ \text{gradient w.r.t rehearsal buffer} R
$$  
4. $CGI$ for $M_g$  
$$
CGI = \text{grad w.r.t task data }D_t + \text{gradient w.r.t rehearsal buffer} R
$$  
5. Update mask by retaining weights with high $CWI$ or $CGI$ value.

# Notable References

# Thoughts

Isn't $CWI$ and $CGI$ are redundant metrics, i.e. not orthogonal enough?  
Applying different masks for forward/backward phase is notable.  
Somewhat very similar with my idea, but somewhat different from what I thought.
